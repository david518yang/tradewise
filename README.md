# Introduction 
In this project, we explored the efficacy of a reinforcement learning approach to 
trading stocks and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) using Q-learning. We developed individual 
agents that learned from historical market data for several stocks and ETFs including 
AAPL (Apple), GOOG (Google), MSFT (Microsoft), QQQ (Nasdaq), SPY (S&P 500), and 
VOO (Vanguard S&P 500), in order to learn what to do in certain market conditions, 
develop an optimized trading strategy, and maximize portfolio returns. 


## Setup 
To run this project, you must begin by installing the necessary libraries:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Afterwards, navigate into the `src` directory and run the following command:
```
python3 main.py
```

Let the agent train and enjoy the results!
